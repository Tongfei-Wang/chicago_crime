# chicago_crime
The current project combined the Chicago crime data from 2008 with the Chicago Census data to provide insightful suggestions to the Chicago Police Department in both the trends in the crimes and improvement of the arrest rate. The project applied timestamp analysis, spatial analysis, and clustering analysis to define trends of crime in Chicago, and identify specific time frames, targeted areas, and neighborhoods with higher crime rates and lower arrest rates. After applying several different machine learning models including Logistic Regression, XG Boost, and Neural Networks, the project eventually chose to use a three-layer Neural Network model with 85% accuracy to predict future arrests.
